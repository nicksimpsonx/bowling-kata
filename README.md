# Bowling Coding Kata
This small application is a time limited implementation of the bowling coding kata, a test driven development approach was taken an I allowed the tests to drive the design of the algorithm, starting off with a very simple test case and then refactoring the tests and the code as more and more tests were added.

## Challenge Objective:
- To make the algorithm as simple as possible in a short space of time using TDD.
- The details of the Kata are here: <https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/>

## Author
This implementation was programmed by **Nicholas Simpson** in December 2020

## How to use
There is no main method in this program so you can run the test class "BowlingGameTests.java" as Junit tests from your IDE, alternatively you can just do a maven clean install from the command line to run the tests.

# Future improvements
- Add error handling for when people try to use invalid score cards
- Refactor so that Frames are defined as objects and are stored in an ordered collection
